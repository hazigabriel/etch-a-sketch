Hello,

This is the second Javascript project, from the Odin's project "Web Development 101" course, after the Rock-paper-scissors game.

The goal of this project is to create a grid, where the user inputs a certain number, let's say X, which would generate a grid with a height and width of X elements, and upon hovering the grid elements they would modify their color, thus the "Etch-a-sketh" name.
